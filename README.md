# Python Design Tools

This is where I keep assorted Python scripts I write that support design tasks.

## Python files

- `src/design_math.py` contains various mathematical constants, sequences, and utilities. This includes things like the Golden Ratio, Golden Angle, Pell numbers, and the Fibonacci sequence.
- `src/swatch_extractor.py` extracts color codes from a text file and generates an SVG with swatches of those colors.
