# Python Design Tools

This is where I keep assorted Python scripts I write that support design tasks.

## Python scripts

- `pydesigntools/swatch_extractor.py` extracts color codes from a text file and generates an SVG with swatches of those colors.
- `pydesigntools/sequence_scaler.py` scales the numeric sequences defined in `pydesigntools.mathutil` relative to a specific value.
- `pydesigntools/ratio_maker.py` generates numeric sequences using the ratios defined in `pydesigntools.mathutil` relative to a specific value.

## Python modules

- `pydesigntools.color` contains utilities for converting, grouping, and sorting colors.
- `pydesigntools.graphics` contains a utility for rendering color swatches as an SVG image.
- `pydesigntools.mathutil` contains various mathematical constants, sequences, and utilities. This includes things like the Golden Ratio, Golden Angle, Pell numbers, and the Fibonacci sequence.
